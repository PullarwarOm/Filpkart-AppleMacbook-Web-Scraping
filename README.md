# Filpkart-Macboob-Web-Scraping
In this repository I uploaded Data set (csv) file, Jupyter notebook with all the codes I used to scrape Data From this site with step by step.
Here In this Repository you will find Jupyter notebook in which there are codes that I  used to scrape data from Flipkart Apple Macbook page, where I scraped Product Name, Price, Total rating of product out of 5, Total number of ratings, Total number of reviews And Product Desciption. I have also uploaded the .csv file that I created with all these information. 
I also made functions to Scrape data from multiple pages. Which will automate the entire process for n number of pages.
